-----

This library provides a wrapped pre-compiled
`libsecp256k1 <https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1>`_, the heavily
optimized C library used by `Bitcoin Core <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin>`_
for operations on elliptic curve secp256k1. It effectively encapsulates a
`libsecp256k1 fork <https://github.com/electrumsv/secp256k1>`_
and allows ElectrumSV developers to have a vetted build, with selected public modifications,
available on pypi to treat as a first classed dependency which can be obtained and verified
against a known hash, like any other Python dependency.

Features
--------

- Linux, macOS, and Windows all have binary packages for 64 bit architectures only.
- Linux & macOS use GMP for faster computation
- Implements a fix for `<https://bugs.python.org/issue28150>`_ to support Python 3.6+ on macOS

Installation
------------

electrumsv-secp256k1 is distributed on PyPI and is available on Linux/macOS and Windows and
supports Python 3.6 and Python 3.7.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install electrumsv-secp256k1

If you are on a system that doesn't have a precompiled binary wheel (e.g. FreeBSD)
then pip will fetch source to build yourself. You must have the necessary packages.

On Debian/Ubuntu for example the necessary packages are:

- build-essential
- automake
- pkg-config
- libtool
- libgmp-dev (optional)

API
---

Anything importing this should be familiar with the underlying libsecp256k1 api.
